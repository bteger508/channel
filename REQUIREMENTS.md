# One-Way Updates

A web app for sharing updates without expecting responses from recipients.

## The Problem

Sometimes you need to communicate without the burden of conversation:
- Sharing recovery updates with family after a medical event
- Sending prayer requests without expecting replies
- Broadcasting announcements when you're too overwhelmed to chat
- Keeping people informed without managing individual responses

## The Solution

Create a shareable update page where you can post timestamped updates. Recipients can view and react with simple emojis (‚ù§Ô∏è üôè üëç) but there's no pressure or expectation to type responses.

## How It Works

1. **Creator creates a page** with a title (e.g., "Sarah's Recovery")
2. **Get a shareable link** to distribute once via text/email
3. **Post updates** as things progress
4. **Recipients view** all updates on the same link
5. **Optional reactions** let people show support without typing

## Key Features

- Simple update posting interface
- Timestamped updates (newest first)
- Shareable link generation
- Low-pressure emoji reactions
- Clean, minimal UI
- No account required (future: optional)

## Current Tech Stack (Prototype)

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State**: Local React state (demo only)

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Backend Setup**
   - Choose backend (Firebase, Supabase, or custom API)
   - Database schema for pages and updates
   - URL shortening/routing

2. **Features to Add**
   - Persistent storage (currently demo uses local state)
   - Real shareable links
   - Optional password protection
   - Update notifications (optional)
   - Archive/delete pages
   - Edit/delete individual updates

3. **Tech Considerations**
   - Authentication (optional - could be page-code based)
   - Database: Firestore, Postgres, or MongoDB
   - Hosting: Vercel, Netlify, or similar
   - Domain & routing setup

## Design Philosophy

**Low Pressure**: The entire UX is designed to remove social pressure. No typing required, no "read receipts", just simple acknowledgment if desired.

**Simple**: No complex features, no accounts (unless needed), just updates and reactions.

**Focused**: Solves one problem really well rather than trying to be a full messaging platform.
